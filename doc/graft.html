    <h2><a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
      <em>Graft</em> provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages under a
      single directory hierarchy. It was inspired by both
      <em>Depot</em> (Carnegie Mellon University) and <em>Stow</em> (Bob
      Glickstein).
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this discussion a <em>package</em> is defined as a
      suite of programs and files that make up an individual product. For
      example, the <em>package</em> known as <em>gcc</em> consists of the
      compiler and preprocessor programs, include files, manual pages and any
      other associated file or program. The concept of a <em>package</em> should
      not be confused with some vendor's definitions that are - by this
      definition - actually collections of <em>packages</em>.

    <h2><a name="rationale" id="rationale">Rationale</a></h2>
    <p>
      In any reasonably large environment, many software packages will be
      installed. The installation location for these packages usually follows
      one of three rationales - each with its own advantages and drawbacks:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Each package is isolated from all other packages by installing it into
          a self contained directory tree. All binaries, manual pages, library
          and configuration files are stored under a single directory tree. This
          directory tree contains NO other files which are not the exclusive
          domain of the package in question.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method makes package demarcation obvious. As each package is self
          contained, identification of any file within a package is immediately
          apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple versions of packages can be installed fairly easily to
          accommodate acceptance testing of new versions and/or legacy systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the use of individual package directories can lead to VERY
          long <strong>$PATH</strong> and <strong>$MANPATH</strong> environment
          variables. Some shells may not be able to handle such long variables.
          Whenever a new package is added, each user MUST update their
          <strong>$PATH</strong> and <strong>$MANPATH</strong> to make the
          package available.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Packages are installed under a common directory tree. Binaries for all
          packages are grouped in a single directory, manual pages for all
          packages in another directory and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method eliminates the need for continually updating long
          <strong>$PATH</strong> variables for each user. As soon as a package
          is placed into the common '<tt>bin</tt>' directory it is immediately
          available to all users (after a shell rehash if necessary).
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when a package is to be updated it is often very difficult to
          isolate all the files related to a particular package if they are
          intermingled with unrelated files.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A combination of methods (1) and (2).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In an effort to maximise the advantages and minimise the disadvantages,
      <em>Depot</em>, <em>Stow</em> and <em>Graft</em> adopt a similar
      philosophy:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Packages are installed in self contained directory trees and symbolic
        links from a common area are made to the package files.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This approach allows multiple versions of the same package to co-exist on
      the one system. One version is the commonly available version and symbolic
      links will be made to this version. New versions can be tested and once
      acceptable can replace the current commonly available version. Older
      versions can still be used for legacy systems by using the '<em>real</em>'
      path name to the package instead of the '<em>common</em>' path name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size and complexity of environment variables such as
      <strong>$PATH</strong> and <strong>$MANPATH</strong> is minimised because
      only the common area is required. Any special cases can also be
      accommodated but these will usually be in the minority when compared with
      the number of commonly available packages.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="research" id="research">Research</a></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Development of <em>Graft</em> began in late 1996.
      The comments regarding the packages listed below reflect their
      functionality and behaviour at that time and may not necessarily reflect
      their current functionality and behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated earlier, <em>Graft</em> was inspired by <em>Depot</em> and
      <em>Stow</em>. Both these systems were examined and finally rejected for
      the following reasons:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <em>Depot</em>
        <a href="ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/depot/depot.tar.gz"
          >ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/depot/depot.tar.gz</a
        >
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p><em>Depot</em> is very flexible yet cumbersome.</p>
        <p>
          It requires a database file to be created which provides a snapshot of
          the current state of both the package repository and the
          <em>Depot</em> target. It is possible to inadvertently destroy the
          package repository if the database is damaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Depot</em> assumes "<em>ownership</em>" of the target area, making
          it almost impossible to accommodate packages that are not under the
          control of <em>Depot</em>. ("<em>Ownership</em>" in this case means
          that <em>Depot</em> assumes ALL files in the target area will be under
          the control of <em>Depot</em>. It does not imply that
          <em>Depot</em> modifies Unix file permissions).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of <em>Depot</em>'s assumed <em>ownership</em> it is difficult
          for other packages not under the control of <em>Depot</em> to be
          placed in the same target area.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Depot</em> attempts to impose a fixed package repository relative
          to the package target. It assumes that all packages will be stored
          under '<tt><em>dir</em>/depot/<em>package</em></tt
          >' and the target will be '<tt><em>dir</em></tt
          >'. This can be overridden on the command line but the internals of
          <em>Depot</em> make this mechanism cumbersome.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Depot</em> is written in C and there are many source files in its
          distribution. Local modifications would be difficult to quickly
          implement and test.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <em>Stow</em>
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/"
          >https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/</a
        >
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          <em>Stow</em> is a stateless system. It requires no database or
          configuration information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like <em>Depot</em>, it assumes that the package repository will be
          stored under '<tt><em>dir</em>/stow/<em>package</em></tt
          >' and the target will be '<tt><em>dir</em></tt
          >'. This can be overridden on the command line and works well during
          the install phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stow</em> assumes "<em>ownership</em>" of the target area, making
          it difficult to accommodate packages that are not under the control of
          <em>Stow</em>. ("<em>Ownership</em>" in this case means that
          <em>Stow</em> assumes ALL files in the target area will be under the
          control of <em>Stow</em>. It does not imply that
          <em>Stow</em> modifies Unix file permissions).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of <em>Stow</em>'s assumed <em>ownership</em> it is difficult
          for other packages not under the control of <em>Stow</em> to be placed
          in the same target area. When deleting packages,
          <em>Stow</em> examines everything in the target directory - whether it
          is associated with the package it is trying to delete or not. This can
          be time consuming and potentially dangerous as empty directories are
          also removed - even empty directories that do not belong to the
          package being removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stow</em> has a clever feature of <em>folding</em> and
          <em>unfolding</em> directories. It attempts to optimise the number of
          symbolic links by making links to directories if the directory is only
          associated with a single package. If at a later date <em>Stow</em>
          discovers another package that needs that directory it will
          <em>unfold</em> that directory into a collection of symbolic links to
          files rather than a single symbolic link to the directory.
          <em>Stow</em> will <em>fold</em> the directory when removing packages
          if the remainder of the directory is only concerned with a single
          package. While clever, this feature is probably a waste of time and
          effort. It means that the entire package target must be scanned to
          determine package ownership of links and as packages will usually be
          replaced by newer versions a directory <em>fold</em> will probably be
          short lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stow</em> will sometimes miss potential conflicts when run in
          <em>show only</em> mode. The conflicts may occur when a directory is
          unfolded and will not show up in <em>show only</em> mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stow</em>'s author suggests that packages be compiled such that
          they refer to files in the target location rather than the actual
          package installation directory. This approach precludes the use of
          multiple versions of packages with different configuration and/or
          library files.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stow</em> is written in <em>Perl</em> and is only a few hundred
          lines of code so local modifications can be accommodated. However
          there are very few comments in the code which makes the process of
          modification difficult.

      Since the release of <em>Graft</em> 1.6, the existence of yet another
      packaging program has been brought to the author's attention.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <em>Encap</em>
        <a
          href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Computers/docs/sysadmin/Build/encap.html"

        >
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          <em>Encap</em> grew out of work begun at the University of Illinois
          Champaign-Urbana. It has the same underlying philosophy as
          <em>Depot</em>, <em>Stow</em> and <em>Graft</em> - encapsulate
          packages into self contained directories and use symbolic links to
          make them visible in a common location.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Encap</em> uses a combination of a <em>csh</em> wrapper and a
          <em>Perl</em> program to accomplish its work. Like both
          <em>Depot</em> and <em>Stow</em>, <em>Encap</em> assumes that all
          compiled packages will live under a single directory hierarchy - by
          default '<tt><em>dir</em>/encap/<em>package</em></tt
          >'. It then attempts to create a symbolic link tree for ALL the
          packages under this area. There doesn't appear to be any easy way to
          support the quick addition or removal of a single package.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new release of <em>Encap</em> incorporating many new features was
          expected to be available in early 1997, however no release greater
          than version 1.2 has been forthcoming.
        </p>
        <p>
          One good feature of <em>Encap</em> is the ability to exclude specific
          files from the package tree. This concept has been incorporated into
          <em>Graft</em> 1.7 and above.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Since the release of <em>Graft</em> 2.3, the existence of several another
      packaging programs have been brought to the author's attention. Rather
      than outline their features and whether or not the author feels they are
      superior (or inferior) to <em>Graft</em>, a reference to each package and
      a brief description is given and further research is left as an exercise
      for the reader:

    <p>
      This brings us to <em>Graft</em>. <em>Graft</em> has been designed to use
      the best features of <em>Depot</em>, <em>Stow</em> and <em>Encap</em>
      while maintaining as simple a mechanism as possible. The principles of
      <em>Graft</em> are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will allow packages to be <em>grafted</em> from any
          directory to any other directory. Default <tt>installation</tt> and
          <tt>target</tt> directories will be used but can easily be overridden
          on the command line.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will log its actions to a log file. The log file can be
          specified on the command line. If not specified on the command line a
          default log file will be used.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will NOT create symbolic links to directories. If a
          directory does not exist in the target tree it will be created (with
          the same ownership and permissions as the original if desired).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will create symbolic links with full pathnames rather
          than relative pathnames. This allows easy identification of true
          package locations and facilitates block movement of a target tree
          without the need for <em>Graft</em> deletion and re-installation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will cease installation of a package if a conflict
          arises. A conflict is defined as one of the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the package object is a directory and the target object exists
            but is not a directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the package object is not a directory and the target object
            exists and is not a symbolic link.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the package object is not a directory and the target object
            exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the package
            object.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the package directory contains a <tt>.graft-config</tt> file and
            the target object exists but does not match the 32-bit CRC of the
            package object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Installation conflicts will always be reported. Conflicts will be
          reported to standard error.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will attempt to display all possible operations when
          asked, even when asked not to perform the operations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will not delete directories when uninstalling.
          <em>Graft</em> will print an appropriate message if an empty directory
          results and leave the deletion for the operator to perform outside the
          scope of <em>Graft</em>'s operations. This ensures that
          <em>place holder</em> directories that may be used by other packages
          are not inadvertently removed. This feature can be permanently
          disabled by setting a flag in the <tt>Makefile</tt>. It can also be
          temporarily disabled using a command line option.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will continue to delete the remainder of a package
          after a conflict arises. This maximises the amount of deletion that
          can be performed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Deletion conflicts will always be reported. Conflicts will be reported
          to standard error.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will only concern itself with files relating to the
          package at hand. This will allow other packages to be placed in the
          target area without fear of intervention by <em>Graft</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Graft</em> will only allow the superuser to install or delete
          packages. This feature can be permanently disabled by setting a flag
          in the <tt>Makefile</tt> or it may be overridden by a command line
          option.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the file <tt>.nograft</tt> exists in any package directory,
          <em>Graft</em> will bypass that directory and any subdirectories
          during installation. The name of this file is specified in the
          <tt>Makefile</tt>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When installing a directory tree, if the file
          <tt>.graft-exclude</tt> exists in any package directory,
          <em>Graft</em> will assume that the file contains a list of file
          and/or directory names - one per line - which correspond to files
          and/or directories in the directory containing the
          <tt>.graft-exclude</tt> file. These files and/or directories will NOT
          be <em>grafted</em>. The name of this file is specified in the
          <tt>Makefile</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt>.nograft</tt> file takes priority over the
          <tt>.graft-exclude</tt> file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When installing a directory tree, if the file
          <tt>.graft-include</tt> exists in any package directory,
          <em>Graft</em> will assume that the file contains a list of file
          and/or directory names - one per line - which correspond to files
          and/or directories in the directory containing the
          <tt>.graft-include</tt> file. ONLY the files and/or directories listed
          in the <tt>.graft-include</tt> will be <em>grafted</em>. The name of
          this file is specified in the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt>.graft-exclude</tt> file takes priority over the
          <tt>.graft-include</tt> file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When installing a directory tree, if the file <tt>.graft-config</tt>
          exists in a package directory, the contents of the directory will be
          <strong>copied</strong> to the target directory. If the target files
          exists and is in conflict with the package file then the package file
          will be copied into the target directory as <tt>file<em>.new</em></tt
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt>.graft-include</tt> file takes priority over the
          <tt>.graft-config</tt> file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the file <tt>.nograft</tt> exists in any package directory, it will
          be ignored and <em>Graft</em> will continue processing the directory
          and any subdirectories during deletion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the file <tt>.graft-exclude</tt> exists in any package directory,
          its contents will be ignored and <em>Graft</em> will continue
          processing the directory and any subdirectories during deletion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the file <tt>.graft-include</tt> exists in any package directory,
          its contents will be ignored and <em>Graft</em> will continue
          processing the directory and any subdirectories during deletion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the file <tt>.graft-config</tt> exists in any package directory,
          during deletion matching files in the target directory will not be
          deleted however any <tt>file<em>.new</em></tt> files will be deleted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As an aid to transitioning systems to <em>Graft</em>, <em>Graft</em>
          will allow conflicting files to be pruned. This pruning can take the
          form of a file rename or a file removal depending on either a
          <tt>Makefile</tt> flag or a command line option. If file removal is
          selected and the file is a non-empty directory, it will be renamed
          instead.

          If the file <tt>.nograft</tt> exists in any package directory, it will

    <h2><a name="history" id="history">History</a></h2>
    <p>
      Development on <em>Graft</em> began in October 1996. The initial design
      used a configuration file to map the installed location of each package to
      its target directory (that is the directory in which the symbolic links
      would be created). Work proceeded at a regular pace and by November 1997
      <em>Graft</em> version <em>2.1</em> was released. In this, and all
      subsequent versions, the configuration file had been removed in favour of
      using default source and target directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further work was performed until September 2000 when the concept of
      bypassing or including files and directories using <tt>.nograft</tt> or
      <tt>.graft-include</tt> files was introduced in <em>Graft</em> version
      <em>2.3</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again nothing changed until February 2002 when Rod Whitby identified a bug
      in the handling of <tt>.graft-include</tt> files. Several other users
      (Peter Bray, Robert Maldon and others) also reported some deprecation
      warnings when using <em>Graft</em> with <em>Perl</em> version
      <em>5.6.0</em>. <em>Graft</em> version <em>2.4</em> was the end of
      <em>Graft</em> development for over a decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2015 Matias A. Fonzo contacted the author wishing to use
      <em>Graft</em> in the
      <a href="http://www.dragora.org/">Dragora GNU/Linux</a> distribution.
      Matias' usage of <em>Graft</em> lead to <em>Graft</em> version
      <em>2.5</em> in June 2015 whereby the <tt>-P</tt> command line option was
      silently ignored if the effective user was not root.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the release of <em>Graft</em> version <em>2.4</em> the author's
      <em>Perl</em> code had improved somewhat so <em>Graft</em> version
      <em>2.6</em> released in July 2015 represented a major clean up of coding
      style and internals. No new behaviours or features were added to the
      <em>2.6</em> release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matias made some more suggestions and improvements up to and including
      <em>Graft</em> version <em>2.16</em> in April 2018. These changes added
      the <tt>.graft-config</tt> control file, the <tt>-r /rootdir</tt> option
      for specifying a new root directory, the <tt>-L</tt> option for displaying
      default locations as well as introducing some tighter controls on the
      messages and exit status of <em>Graft</em> under various conditions.

    <h2><a name="installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Before installing <em>Graft</em> you'll need <em>Perl</em> 5.<em>x</em>.
      <em>Graft</em> version 2.<em>x</em> requires features only available with
      <em>Perl</em> 5.<em>x</em> and will not run with
      <em>Perl</em> 4.<em>x</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your operating system and its file system(s) should also support symbolic
      links. If you can't make symbolic links then you can't use <em>Graft</em>!
      <em>Graft</em> will exit gracefully if your version of <em>Perl</em> does
      not support symbolic links. It will also exit gracefully if you attempt to
      <em>graft</em> a package into a file system that does not support symbolic
      links - from a Linux <tt>ext4</tt> file system into an <tt>vfat</tt> file
      system for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Graft</em> has been written to ensure it uses <em>Perl</em> modules
      that are considered part of the core <em>Perl</em> distribution. However
      it may be possible that you're using a home grown installation of
      <em>Perl</em> or some distribution that doesn't have the same
      <em>Perl</em> modules as the author's development environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is the case you'll see compile failures for the following modules
      if they are unavailable:
    </p>
    <pre>
   File::Basename
   Getopt::Long
</pre
    >
    <p>
      You will not be able to install <em>Graft</em> until these modules are
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also see run-time failures when using <em>Graft</em> with
      <tt>.graft-config</tt> files if the following modules are unavailable:
    </p>
    <pre>
   Compress::Raw::Zlib    (<EM>used in install and delete modes</EM>)
   File::Copy             (<EM>only used in install mode</EM>)
</PRE>
    <p>
      If you don't have these modules and you do not intend to use
      <tt>.graft-config</tt> files then you can continue to use
      <em>Graft</em> without issue.
    </p>
    <p>Follow these instructions to install <em>Graft</em>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Unpack the gzipped <em>Graft</em> distribution:</p>
        <pre>
    gunzip -c graft-2.16.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>change directories to the <em>Graft</em> distribution directory:</p>
        <pre>
    cd graft-2.16
</pre
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create an writable version of the <tt>Makefile</tt> by running the

        </p>
        <pre>
    make -f Makefile.dist
</pre
        >
        <p>You'll see output similar to</p>

        <p>
          You can ignore the error message. That is just there to prevent the
          creation of the <em>graft</em> executable before you've made your site
          specific configurations to the <tt>Makefile</tt>.

      </li>
      <li>

          Edit the <tt>Makefile</tt>. The following variables should be modified
          to suit your local requirements:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dd>
            <pre>

          </dd>
          <dd>
            <p>
              These two variables control your default package
              <tt>installation</tt> and <tt>target</tt> directories. Most sites
              will probably choose to install packages under a common
              <tt>installation</tt> directory and then <em>graft</em> them into
              a common <tt>target</tt> directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              If no specific <tt>target</tt> directory is given on the command
              line, <em>Graft</em> will use the default value specified by
              <strong>TARGETDIR</strong>. If a <tt>target</tt> directory is
              given on the command line but is not fully qualified, the value
              specified by <strong>TARGETDIR</strong> will be prepended to the
              command line argument.
            </p>
            <p>
              Package names provided to <em>Graft</em> that are not fully
              qualified will have the value specified by
              <strong>PACKAGEDIR</strong> prepended to the command line
              arguments.
            </p>

              There should be no need to modify these values unless you wish to
              install <em>Graft</em> into a directory that is different from
              your default package installation directory. If you do modify
              <strong>TOP</strong> you should not change the values of
              <strong>BIN</strong>, <strong>MAN</strong> and
              <strong>DOC</strong>. If you feel you must change these values
              then perhaps you've misunderstood the concept behind
              <em>Graft</em> so a re-read of this document may be in order.

              This variable refers to the location of the <em>Perl</em> 5.<em
                >x</em
              >
              that will be used by the <em>Graft</em> executable. If you plan on
              <em>grafting</em> <em>Perl</em> then this value should be the
              <em>grafted</em> location of <em>Perl</em> rather than the
              installation location of <em>Perl</em>. If you are using an
              operating system that comes with <em>Perl</em> 5.<em>x</em> - such
              as RedHat or Ubuntu Linux - then you don't need to worry about
              <em>grafting</em> <em>Perl</em> so the value of
              <strong>PERL</strong> should reflect its installed location.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most Unix, Linux and other Unix like operating systems ship with
              <em>Perl</em> these days so modifying this value is probably
              unnecessary.

              These variables hold the names of the special <em>Graft</em>

              obvious names. If you want the files to appear in a simple

              code repositories as used by systems such as <em>CVS</em>, or
              perhaps lockfiles. The default value is empty but if you wish to
              specify values, simply add them to the variable using only
              whitespace as a separator. For example:
            </p>

              If this variable is set to <strong>1</strong>, the files and/or
              directories specified by <strong>GRAFT-NEVER</strong> will be
              automatically excluded from the <em>grafted</em> directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this variable is set to <strong>0</strong>, the files and/or
              directories specified by <strong>GRAFT-NEVER</strong> will be not
              be excluded from the <em>grafted</em> directory.

            </p>
            <p>
              The automatic exclusion is bypassed completely if the

              If this variable is set to <strong>1</strong> only the superuser

              This can be overridden by the use of the
              <strong>-u</strong> command line option. If this variable is set
              to <strong>0</strong>, superuser privileges are not required and
              the <strong>-u</strong> override command line option is disabled.

              If you are installing a private copy of <em>Graft</em> to manage

              <strong>SUPERUSER</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're using <em>Graft</em> to manage a global set of packages
              you should set <strong>SUPERUSER</strong> to <strong>1</strong>.

              When <em>grafting</em> packages, <em>Graft</em> will create new

              <strong>PRESERVEPERMS</strong> to <strong>1</strong>, the original
              user id, group id and file modes will be carried over to the new
              directory. This variable is used only if
              <strong>SUPERUSER</strong> is set to <strong>1</strong>. The sense
              of this variable can be reversed using the
              <strong>-P</strong> command line option.

              When deleting <em>grafted</em> packages, <em>Graft</em> may leave
              empty directories. Setting <strong>DELETEOBJECTS</strong> to
              <strong>1</strong> will allow <em>Graft</em> to delete these
              directories. If <strong>DELETEOBJECTS</strong> is
              <strong>0</strong> then <em>Graft</em> will display an appropriate
              message reminding the user that a directory has been emptied. The
              sense of this variable can be reversed using the
              <strong>-D</strong> command line option.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's probably not good practise to set this value to
              <strong>1</strong> as some directories may be used as place
              holders by a number of different packages. If the value is set to
              <strong>0</strong> deletion of directories can be forced via the
              <strong>-D</strong> command line option.
            </p>
            <p>
              When pruning packages, <em>graft</em> can either remove
              conflicting files or rename them. If
              <strong>DELETEOBJECTS</strong> is set to <strong>1</strong> the
              default prune action will be to delete conflicting objects. If
              <strong>DELETEOBJECTS</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong> the
              default prune action will be to rename conflicting objects. The
              sense of this variable can be reversed using the
              <strong>-D</strong> command line option.

    <p>
      Embedded into the <em>Graft</em> executable is the location of the
      <em>Perl</em> executable. If you've understood the concept behind
      <em>Graft</em> then this location may be the <em>grafted</em> location of
      <em>Perl</em> rather than the true location of <em>Perl</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This presents a dilemma when you come to <em>graft</em> both
      <em>Graft</em> and <em>Perl</em>. You can't run the
      <em>grafted</em> location of the <em>Graft</em> executable because it
      doesn't exist yet, and you can't run the real location of the
      <em>Graft</em> executable because <em>Perl</em> hasn't been
      <em>grafted</em> yet.
    </p>
    <p>Assuming that <em>Graft</em> and <em>Perl</em> are installed in</p>
    <pre>
    /usr/local/pkgs/graft-2.16
    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2
</pre
    >
    <p>you can resolve this dilemma by executing the following commands:</p>
    <pre>
    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /usr/local/pkgs/graft-2.16/bin/graft -i graft-2.16
    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /usr/local/pkgs/graft-2.16/bin/graft -i perl-5.18.2
</pre
    >
    <p>
      This will <em>graft</em> both <em>Graft</em> and <em>Perl</em> from the
      default package installation directory (as specified by
      <strong>PACKAGEDIR</strong> in the <tt>Makefile</tt>) into your default
      target directory (as specified by <strong>TARGETDIR</strong> in the
      <tt>Makefile</tt>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't wish to use the default directories you can use the following
      commands to <em>graft</em> the packages into <tt>/pkgs</tt> instead of
      <tt>/usr/local</tt> for example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /usr/local/pkgs/graft-2.16/bin/graft -i -t /pkgs /usr/local/pkgs/graft-2.16
    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /usr/local/pkgs/graft-2.16/bin/graft -i -t /pkgs /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2
</pre
    >
    <p>
      Now both <em>Graft</em> and <em>Perl</em> have been <em>grafted</em> and
      any other package can be <em>grafted</em> by executing the simpler
      command:
    </p>
    <pre>
    graft -i <em>package</em>
</pre
    >
    <p>
      The <em>Graft</em> distribution includes a program called
      <tt>graftBootStrap.sh</tt> which allows you to easily <em>graft</em> both
      <em>Graft</em> and <em>Perl</em>. It can be found in the
      <em>contrib</em> directory of the distribution. Thanks to Gordon Rowell
      for providing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also find the <tt>-L</tt> command line option to be useful to
      programmatically determine where <em>Graft</em> expects to find
      <em>Perl</em> along with the default locations of its log file, target and
      package directories. See the <a href="#graft-L">Information</a> section
      below for details.

    <p>
      Any packages you wish to place under the control of <em>Graft</em> should
      be compiled and installed in such a way that any package dependent files
      are referenced with the ACTUAL package installation directory rather than
      the common area in which <em>Graft</em> will be creating symbolic links.
      For example, ensure that <em>Perl</em> version <em>5.18.2</em> is looking
      for its library files in
      <tt>/usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/perl5</tt> instead of
      <tt>/usr/local/lib/perl5</tt>. This approach will allow you to easily
      separate multiple versions of the same package without any problems.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Before creating the symbolic links from the target directory to the
      package directory, you may wish to see what actions <em>Graft</em> will
      perform. Execute the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
    graft -i -n <em>package-name</em>
</pre
    >
    <p>
      The <tt>-i</tt> option tells <em>Graft</em> to install the package and the
      <tt>-n</tt> option tells <em>Graft</em> to report on its actions without
      actually performing them. The default <em>Graft</em> target directory will
      be used and the package installation directory will be taken from the
      fully qualified package argument or the default value will be prepended to
      the package argument if it is not fully qualified.
    </p>
    <p><em>Graft</em> will report on the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Installing links to <em>package-location</em> in
          <em>package-target</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Indicates the real package location and its <em>grafted</em> target.

          <em>Graft</em> could not successfully process a package object. One of

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The package object is a directory and the target object exists but
            it not a directory.

          <li>
            The package object is not a directory and the target object exists

          </li>
          <li>
            The package object is not a directory and the target object exists

        <p>
          Conflicts are ALWAYS reported on standard error. If you wish to see if
          the installation of a package will have any conflicts, you can
          execute:
        </p>
        <pre>
    graft -i -n <em>package-name</em> &gt; /dev/null
</pre
        >
        <p>
          Only <tt>CONFLICT</tt> messages will be displayed. If nothing is
          displayed then you can safely conclude that this package can be
          installed using <em>Graft</em> without any conflicts.
        </p>
      </li>

      If you were to test the installation of the <em>kermit-5A190</em> package

      This output shows you that most of the directories already exist
      (indicated by the <tt>NOP</tt> flags). A symbolic link will be created in
      the relevant target directory to each of the files in the
      <em>kermit-5A190</em> package. One directory exists in the
      <em>kermit-5A190</em> package that does not exist in the target -
      <tt>doc</tt>. This directory will be created by <em>Graft</em>.

    <p>
      <strong>NOTE</strong>: If you are using the <em>automounter</em> you may
      not be able to create the directory <tt>/usr/local/doc</tt>. You'll have
      to create the directory on the NFS server under the file system in which
      it really lives. You should be familiar with the peculiarities of the
      <em>automounter</em> and your specific site configuration before creating
      any directories directly under mount points used by the
      <em>automounter</em>.

      You may have the need to place only part of a package under the control of
      <em>Graft</em>. Examples of such occasions may be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The contents of one package conflict with another package. For example
          <tt>/usr/local/pkgs/gcc-2.7.2.1/lib/libiberty.a</tt> and
          <tt>/usr/local/pkgs/gdb-4.16/lib/libiberty.a</tt>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A package directory is obviously the exclusive domain of the package
          and no benefit will be gained by creating symbolic links to its files.
          For example <tt>/usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/perl5</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE</strong>: This will ONLY work if you originally compiled
          and installed the package such that it refers to its files by their
          '<em>real</em>' pathnames and NOT by the virtual pathnames provided by
          <em>Graft</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can force <em>Graft</em> to bypass a directory by creating the file
    </p>
    <pre>
    <em>package-name/dir/dir/</em>.nograft
</pre
    >
    <p>Using the second example above, if you were to create the file:</p>

    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/perl5/.nograft

    >
    <p>
      <em>Graft</em> would create directories and symbolic links for every file
      and directory down to <tt>/usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib</tt>. The
      <tt>perl5</tt> directory and anything below it would not be created.

      Consider the <em>a2ps</em> package for example. When installed it contains

      The only directory you wish to <em>graft</em> is the

    <p>
      There may be the occasional need to exclude specific files and/or
      directories from a directory, rather than the entire directory itself. An
      example of such an occurrence would be the case where files from different
      packages have the same name. <em>Emacs</em> and <em>Xemacs</em> use the
      same names for a number of their configuration files for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can force <em>Graft</em> to exclude any number of files and/or

    <pre>
    /usr/local/etc/visudo

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Any entries made in a <tt>.graft-exclude</tt> file

    <h3>
      <a name="config_dirs" id="config_dirs">Grafting configuration files</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Beginning with <em>Graft</em> 2.11 there is now the ability to treat a
      package directory as a repository for configuration files. In this case
      you would place a <tt>.graft-config</tt> file in the package directory and
      any files in that directory would be <strong>copied</strong> to the target
      directory. Files in conflict would also be copied but would have a default
      suffix of <em>.new</em> to ensure the existing file is not clobbered.
      Conflict discovery is achieved using a simple 32-bit CRC check. This
      feature has been added to assist operating system distributors manage
      system configuration files, specifically it was added at the request of
      the maintainer of the
      <a href="http://www.dragora.org/">Dragora GNU/Linux</a> distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following example. You may wish to upgrade the
      <em>openssh</em> server as part of an upgrade to your distribution. In
      order to preserve any local user modifications to the relevant
      configuration files you would add a <tt>.graft-config</tt> file to the
      package as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/etc/default/.graft-config
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/etc/init.d/.graft-config
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/etc/init/.graft-config
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/etc/network/if-up.d/.graft-config
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/etc/pam.d/.graft-config
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/etc/ufw/applications.d/.graft-config
    /usr/local/pkgs/openssh-server-6.61/lib/systemd/system/.graft-config
</pre
    >
    <p>
      The other directories in the distribution would not require any control
      files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine that the local administrator has made some changes to
      <tt>/etc/pam.d/sshd</tt> such as adding additional authentication methods
      to support two-factor authentication for example. As the distribution
      maintainer you do not want to reverse this local change so when the local
      administrator upgrades the distribution, <em>Graft</em>
      <strong>copies</strong> the new <tt>/etc/pam.d/sshd</tt> file to
      <tt>/etc/pam.d/sshd.new</tt> which allows the local administrator to merge
      their changes with any new features supported by the upgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take full advantage of this feature you may need to explicitly set the
      target directory as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
    graft -i -t / openssh-server-6.61
</pre
    >

    <p>
      Some packages can be successfully used when only part of their
      installation directory is <em>grafted</em>. Other packages are
      recalcitrant and need some special hand holding which can only be solved
      by <em>grafting</em> each section of the package separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first scenario can be handled by either <tt>.nograft</tt> files or
      partial <em>grafts</em>. Consider <em>Perl</em> version <em>5.18.2</em>.
      When installed in its own directory
    </p>
    <pre>
    /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2

      Everything in the <tt>lib</tt> directory is exclusive to <em>Perl</em> and

      <em>grafted</em> using either of the following two methods:
    </p>
    <pre>
    touch /usr/local/pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/.nograft
    graft -i perl-5.18.2

      <em>grafted</em> are in <tt>common/man</tt>. Everything else in the
      package does not need to be <em>grafted</em>. If the entire package was to
      be <em>grafted</em> the result would be two directories that are not in
      the regular <strong>$PATH</strong> and
      <strong>$MANPATH</strong> environment variables - namely
      <tt>/usr/local/common/man</tt> and <tt>/usr/local/sunpro/bin</tt>, plus a
      host of other directories that are not relevant for <em>grafting</em>. No

    <p>The solution is to use two partial <em>grafts</em>:</p>

    <h3><a name="conflicts" id="conflicts">Conflict Processing</a></h3>
    <p>
      Occasionally <em>Graft</em> will fail to completely install a package.
      This occurs because <em>Graft</em> encounters a conflict. A conflict is
      defined as one of the following possibilities:
    </p>
    <div class="c1">
      <table summary="Conflcits" border="2" cellpadding="3">
        <tr>
          <th>Package Object</th>
          <th>Target Object</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>directory</td>
          <td>not a directory</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>file</td>
          <td>directory</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>file</td>
          <td>file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>file</td>
          <td>symbolic link to something other than the package object</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>
      If <em>Graft</em> encounters such a conflict during the installation of a
      package it will report the conflict and exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolving the conflict depends on the nature of the conflict and is beyond
      the scope of this discussion - however most conflicts will either be the
      result of attempting to <em>graft</em> a package on top of the same
      package actually installed in the target directory or a file name clash
      between two (or more) different packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conflicts arising from the pre-existence of a package in the target
      directory can be resolved using <em>graft</em>'s prune mechanism described
      above in
      <a href="#transitioning"
        >"Transitioning a package to <em>Graft</em> control"</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      File name clash conflicts can be resolved by the use of either a
      <a href="#bypass"><tt>.nograft</tt></a> or
      <a href="#exclude"><tt>.graft-exclude</tt></a> file or by
      <em>grafting</em> only part of a package as described above in
      <a href="#partial-graft">"Grafting part of a package"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em>Graft</em> encounters a conflict while deleting a package, it will
      report the conflict and continue deleting the remainder of the package. In
      this way <em>Graft</em> will delete as much of the package as possible.
      Conflicts that arise during deletion will probably be the result of an
      incorrectly installed package or the installation of other components of
      the same package without the use of <em>Graft</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conflict messages are written to standard error. All other messages are
      written to standard output. To quickly determine if a package will have
      any conflicts when <em>grafted</em>, redirect standard output to
      <tt>/dev/null</tt>
    </p>
    <pre>
    graft -i -n <em>package</em> &gt; /dev/null
</pre
    >
    <p>
      If you don't see any output then you can safely assume that there will be
      no conflicts when <em>grafting</em> this package.

        >Using <em>Graft</em> with other package management tools</a
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most Unix vendors have released their own package management tools with
      their operating systems. Examples of this are Solaris 2.<em>x</em> with
      its <em>SVR4 Package Manager</em> <tt>pkgadd</tt>, RedHat Linux with its
      <em>RedHat Package Manager</em> <tt>rpm</tt>, Ubuntu Linux (and other
      Debian Linux derivatives) with its <tt>dpkg</tt> system and HP-UX 10.<em
        >x</em
      >
      with its <tt>swinstall</tt> suite. <em>Graft</em> has been designed as an
      adjunct to these package managers rather than a competitor. The author has
      used <em>Graft</em> successfully with all of the operating systems
      mentioned here.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Many useful packages available in the public domain and from other
          commercial sources are not shipped with most flavours of Unix.
          <em>Graft</em> can be used to maintain a rich package environment
          beyond the set of packages provided by your vendor. Vendor based
          packages can still be maintained using the vendor's tools and
          <em>Graft</em> can be used to maintain your own packages.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The vendor based management tools are usually used to maintain single
          instances of a package on each machine. It is often difficult to have
          multiple versions of the same package coexisting on the same machine.
          <em>Graft</em> can be used to maintain multiple versions of a package
          to support legacy, production and development requirements
          simultaneously.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Another common problem with vendor supplied software is the speed at
          which upgrades are available. The large vendors are not known for
          providing quick fixes to many of their packages. (Notable exceptions
          to this are the vendors of operating systems based on open source
          software who can draw on the enormous number of users who submit
          patches because the source code is available). Using
          <em>Graft</em> you can obtain a working public domain version of a
          package (if one exists of course) and install it in a different
          location to the vendor copy. When the vendor releases a new version of
          the package, it can be installed using the vendor's package management
          tool and your <em>grafted</em> copy can be removed (only if the
          vendor's version of the package is better than the public domain
          version).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Sometimes, a vendor's package doesn't quite perform in the manner
          you'd like. It may be making assumptions about your file system(s)
          that are incorrect for your environment or it may not have all the
          features you'd like. If an alternative package is available - either
          in the public domain or from other commercial sources - it can be
          installed and <em>grafted</em> accordingly.
