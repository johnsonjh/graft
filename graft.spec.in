# LinuxMint 17.3 (a Debian derivative). So it may not work as expected when
# running on a system that actually uses RPM as its package manager. If you
# find this to be the case AND you get it working please let me know so I
# can update this spec file and its corresponding Makefile target
# appropriately. Thanks!

%description
Graft provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages under a single
directory hierarchy. Packages are installed in self contained directory
trees and symbolic links from a common area are made to the package files.

This approach allows multiple versions of the same package to co-exist on
the one system. One version is the commonly available version and symbolic
links will be made to this version. New versions can be tested and once
acceptable can replace the current commonly available version. Older
versions can still be used for legacy systems by using the 'real' path
name to the package instead of the 'common' path name.

%changelog
* Mon Apr 16 2018 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.16-01]
- updated rmfiles() to finish handling orphaned symlinks. Thanks to
  Matias A. Fonzo.
- updated man page. Modified logfile table to remove roff errors re
  "cannot adjust line". Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
- updated man page. Expanded -r rootdir description to make it clearer.

* Fri Apr 13 2018 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.15-01]
- removed PostScript version of documentation. Saves 1.1M for downloads.
  After discussions with Matias A. Fonzo.
- fixed mklink to check for existing links to orphaned source symlinks. Bug
  introduced in 2.11. Fixed by restoring original logic order. Thanks to
  Matias A. Fonzo.

* Thu Apr 12 2018 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.14-01]
- added -L option to show default locations of perl, log file, target
  dir, and package dir. After feedback from Matias A. Fonzo.

* Tue Mar 13 2018 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.13-01]
- added -r rootdir option to perform chroot() prior to all operations.
  Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
- call to ls now calls /bin/ls (only used if copying with preserved
  permissions)
- using simple stat() instead of /bin/ls if -r rootdir is also specified
- minor optimizations in logger() calls

* Tue Feb 16 2017 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.12-01]
- fixed delete mode for .graft-config files. Was deleting the file instead
  of preserving it. Also enforcing CRC checks on deletion in the same mode.
  Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
- .graft-config mode now preserves permissions on copied files when
  SUPERUSER=1 and PRESERVEPERMS=1 are set in the Makefile.
  Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.

* Tue Jan 31 2017 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.11-01]
- usage details for -C only appear if the Makefile specifies targets for
  GRAFT-NEVER. Repeated for man page.
- all $option{x} instances replaced by $option{descriptiveWord}. Makes it
  easier for me to read the code :)
- added .graft-config control file. This is a special case where the source
  directory is _copied_ to the target rather than making symbolic links. If
  there is a conflict then a file.new will be copied instead. This lead to
  a major re-write of install(), uninstall() and prune(). Requested by
  Matias A. Fonzo.
- major rewrite of the man page
- update to the graft.spec file to support "make rpm"
- created Debian control file to support "make deb"
- updated README with simple installation instructions

* Fri Nov 25 2016 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.10-01]
- modifies conflict messages on deletion if .nograft or .graft-exclude is
  in play

* Tue Aug 2 2016 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.9-01]
- exit statuses honoured even in -n mode. Requested by Matias A. Fonzo.

* Mon Nov 23 2015 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.8-01]
- fixed trivial bug in 2.7. Graft was always exiting with status 4 :(

* Fri Nov 20 2015 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.7-01]
- graft exits with a status of 4 if the logfile cannot be updated. Any
  other error condition will override this action. Requested by Matias A.
  Fonzo.

* Sat Jul 11 2015 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.6-01]
- Updated manual page to provide more explict description of what
  constitutes a package. Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
- Updated man page to show that the are no files for -C (when appropriate).
- Updated manual page to show the location of the html/ps/pdf/txt docs.
- Move graft.1 to graft.man so that graft.1 can be built as part of a
  simple make.
- Added generic targets to the Makefile for .pl and .man dependencies.
- Code cleanup and reworking. Runtime configuration and command line
  options now stored in %config and %options hashes respectively. All that
  work is done in an init() subroutine.
- Updated my email addess in all relevant files.
- Updated location of graft homepage to
  http://peters.gormand.com.au/Home/tools/graft in all relevant files.
- Updated html documentation to bring it up to date with respect to Perl
  versions and the fact that most distros ship with Perl these days so the
  bootstrap problem is not as important.
- Updated spec file to generate Makefile then use it.

* Fri Jun 26 2015 Peter Samuel <peter.r.samuel@gmail.com>
- [2.5-01]
- Silently ignores -P option if effective user is not root

* Mon Feb 25 2002 Peter Samuel <peters@e-smith.com>
- [2.4-01]
- First release as an RPM
