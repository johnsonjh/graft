Version 2.16 - 16 April 2018

    - updated rmfiles() to finish handling orphaned symlinks. Thanks to
      Matias A. Fonzo.
    - updated man page. Modified logfile table to remove roff errors re
      "cannot adjust line". Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
    - updated man page. Expanded -r rootdir description to make it clearer.

Version 2.15 - 13 April 2018

    - removed PostScript version of documentation. Saves 1.1M for
      downloads. After discussions with Matias A. Fonzo.
    - fixed mklink to check for existing links to orphaned source symlinks.
      Bug introduced in 2.11. Fixed by restoring original logic order.
      Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.14 - 12 April 2018

    - added -L option to show default locations of perl, log file, target
      dir, and package dir. After feedback from Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.13 - 13 March 2018

    - added -r rootdir option to perform chroot() prior to all operations.
      Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
    - call to ls now calls /bin/ls (only used if copying with preserved
      permissions)
    - using simple stat() instead of /bin/ls if -r rootdir is also
      specified
    - minor optimizations in logger() calls

Version 2.12 - 16 February 2017

    - fixed delete mode for .graft-config files. Was deleting the file
      instead of preserving it. Also enforcing CRC checks on deletion in
      the same mode. Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
    - .graft-config mode now preserves permissions on copied files when
      SUPERUSER=1 and PRESERVEPERMS=1 are set in the Makefile. Thanks to
      Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.11 - 31 January 2017

    - usage details for -C only appear if the Makefile specifies targets
      for GRAFT-NEVER. Repeated for man page.
    - all $option{x} instances replaced by $option{descriptiveWord}. Makes
      it easier for me to read the code :)
    - added .graft-config control file. This is a special case where the
      source directory is _copied_ to the target rather than making
      symbolic links. If there is a conflict then a file.new will be copied
      instead. This lead to a major re-write of install(), uninstall() and
      prune(). Requested by Matias A. Fonzo.
    - major rewrite of the man page
    - update to the graft.spec file to support "make rpm"
    - created Debian control file to support "make deb"
    - updated README with simple installation instructions

Version 2.10 - 25 November 2016

    - modifies conflict messages on deletion if .nograft or .graft-exclude
      is in play. Requested by Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.9 - 2 August 2016

    - -n option honours exit status on conflict. Requested by
      Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.8 - 23 November 2015

    - fixed trivial bug in 2.7. Graft was always exiting with status 4 :(

Version 2.7 - 20 November 2015

    - graft exits with a status of 4 if the logfile cannot be updated. Any
      other error condition will override this action. Requested by
      Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.6 - 11 July 2015

    - Updated manual page to provide more explict description of what
      constitutes a package. Thanks to Matias A. Fonzo.
    - Updated manual page to show that the are no files for -C (when appropriate).
    - Updated manual page to show the location of the html/ps/pdf/txt docs.
    - Move graft.1 to graft.man so that graft.1 can be built as part of a
      simple make.
    - Added generic targets to the Makefile for .pl and .man dependencies.
    - Code cleanup and reworking. Runtime configuration and command line
      options now stored in %config and %options hashes respectively. All
      that work is done in an init() subroutine.
    - Updated my email address in all relevant files.
    - Updated location of graft homepage to
      http://peters.gormand.com.au/Home/tools/graft in all relevant files.
    - Updated html documentation to bring it up to date with respect to
      Perl versions and the fact that most distros ship with Perl these
      days so the bootstrap problem is not as important.
    - Updated spec file to generate Makefile then use it.

Version 2.5 - 26 June 2015

    - Silently ignore -P if the effective user is not root. Thanks to
      Matias A. Fonzo.

Version 2.4 - 25 February 2002

    - Code cleanup. Fixed lots of Perl style issues. (More to come)
    - Fixed nasty bug where .graft-include files were being honoured
      across multiple directories. This also fixes the problem
      regarding defined(%hash) deprecation messages with perl 5.6.0 and
      above. Thanks to Rod Whitby for reporting the .graft-include
      bug. Thanks also to Peter Bray and Robert Maldon (and many
      others) for reporting the perl 5.6.0 issue.
    - Precedence rules for .graft-exclude and .graft-include are now honoured.
    - Empty top level target directory is no longer removed when using -dD.
    - Message formats are now normalised. Each type of message has a
      fixed length tag which can be used by post-processors (none exist,
      but feel free to write one if you feel you need one). Thanks to
      Peter Bray for this request.
    - Implement Peter Bray's suggestion for never grafting specific
      files and/or directories. List is specified in Makefile.
    - Removed some intelligence from the Makefile to cope with the brain
      damaged make shipped with Solaris. Thanks to Peter Bray, Robert
      Maldon and Jonathan Woolmington for reporting this "bug".
    - Added license details to man page and documentation.
    - Added details regarding other similar packages to the
      documentation. Thanks to Bud Bruegger, Jonathan Abbey and Al Piszcz
      for providing details regarding these programs.
    - Added a THOUGHTS files. This outlines potential new ideas for
      graft and also why older ideas have been rejected. If your idea
      isn't yet in graft it might be mentioned in THOUGHTS.

Version 2.3 - 7 September 2000

    - Code cleanup. Fixed lots of Perl style issues.
    - Now uses Perl File::Basename module for basename() and dirname()
      instead of internal routines.
    - Removed a bunch of other internal routines that are no longer
      needed.
    - Makefile now allows setting of pruned file suffix.
    - Makefile now allows using a different location of perl to build
      the graft executable.
    - Documentation is installed 644 to avoid re-installation
      problems.
    - Added Robert Maldon's patches to implement graft include mechanism.
    - .graft-exclude now handles directories too.
    - Lots of HTML style cleanups in the doco.
    - Updated doco for new changes.
    - Now including a PDF version of the doco.
    - Now released under the GPL.

Version 2.2 - 18 November 1997

    - Removed graft_it.pl from contrib. Michael won't be supporting it
      and it's not required now that version graft 2.x is available.
    - removed deprecated "$#rcsid" in favour of "scalar @rcsid"
    - added -u option to override superuser privileges
    - reinstated failure on bad options - &getopts returns NULL for
      unknown options
    - Makefile now installs documentation
    - updated documentation - fixed a couple of errors, added
      "Availability" section, updated references for 2.2.

Version 2.1 - 11 November 1997

    - Major modifications
    - uses "-w" perl command line option and "use strict" to enforce
      perl 5 usage conventions. Can no longer use perl 4. This seems
      to fix problem with segmentation violations when running graft
      under perl 5.004.
    - no longer uses config file
    - default package installation and graft target directories
      hard coded from values specified in Makefile
    - actual package installation directory can be overridden on command
      line using fully qualified path
    - graft target directory can be overridden on command line using -t
      option and a fully qualified path
    - Depot/Stow compatibility mode
    - prune functionality now incorporated into graft
    - empty directory deletion and removal of conflicting files during
      prune now set in Makefile. Defaults can be overridden on command
      line.
    - bypass and exclude filenames can be specified in the Makefile.
    - Actions listed in log file. Conflicts (summary) also listed in
      log file.
    - Superuser restrictions now set in Makefile. If superuser is not
      required, preserve directory permissions option is disabled.

Version 1.10 - 17 June 1997

    - Created this CHANGES file
    - added prune.pl for easier migration to graft from already
      installed packages.
    - added contributed code from Gordon Rowell and Michael
      O'Sullivan.
    - can now handle multiple instances of a package provided they
      have different installation directories - useful for grafting
      partial packages. See doc/graft.* for more details.

Version 1.9 - 7 April 1997

    - changed Uninstalling message
    - added failure logic to symlinks

Version 1.8 - 20 March 1997

    - variables used in greps have non alphanumerics escaped with
      backslashes using escape(). Allows packages such as libg++-2.7.2
      to be interpreted as expected instead of seeing the + characters
      as part of a regexp.

Version 1.7 - 19 March 1997

    - added check to die if symlinks are not supported
    - added ".graft-exclude" specific file exclusion logic
    - fixed a couple of minor message errors. No change to
      functionality but it made the code consistent.

Version 1.6 - 16 December 1996

    - changed exit status so that errors have non zero status

Version 1.5 - 4 December 1996

    - fixed bug in conflict reporting. Error type should have been
      ERROR for
          "$target/$file is linked to something other than $location/$file"

Version 1.4 - 13 November 1996

    - added uniq subroutine
    - files() and directories() now do the right thing with symlinks to
      directories

Version 1.3 - 8 November 1996

    - "-l" now only lists valid packages
    - new option "-c" checks config file syntax
    - new option -c does rigorous checking of config file
    - directories are not stat()ed until installation time
    - normalised error messages by using message()

Version 1.2 - 24 October 1996
